ET-simulation

All the important functions are saves in the class Polim
There are three main sections:
1. plot 2D portrait by setting the dipole orientation and steady energy tranfer matrix.
2. fit the 2D portrait by SFA+3 model and plot the fitting result to check the residue.
3. reconstruct 2D portrait of Fnoet, Fet and model

Some notes for myself

ex - et - em
projection = dot product = np.dot(a,b)

np.matrix and np.array are different

normalization
np.sum(Ftotnormed) = 1 
np.sum(model) = 1
