ET-simulation

et_simulation_main includes two main sections
1. plot_2D_portrait.py: plot 2D portrait by setting the dipole orientation and steady energy tranfer matrix.
2. SFA3.py: fit the 2D portrait by SFA+3 model and plot the result to check the residue.

Some notes for myself

ex - et - em
projection = dot product = np.dot(a,b)

np.matrix and np.array are different

normalization
np.sum(Ftotnormed) = 1 
np.sum(model) = 1
